## Complexity
  - The complexity is expressed on 2 axes, the space and the time.
    - ### The space
      - The space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. 
    - ### The time
      - The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.
        - #### The best-case complexity : when the data looks the best
        - #### The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst
        - #### The average-case complexity: when the data looks average
    - ### The big O notation
      - The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation
